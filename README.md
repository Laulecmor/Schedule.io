# Schedule.io

##ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

For this assignment, I corrected HTML by adding time blocks to make it 9am to 5pm. 
For the JS part of the assignment, I added a function through Dayjs to add both the day and time for the scheduling part. 

I then added a function to change the color for each block based on the time it is and if the time had passed. 

I then added a function to save the text in the local storage and to add it in the block when you hit the save button.
